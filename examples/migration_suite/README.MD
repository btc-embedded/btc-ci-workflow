# BTC Migration Suite

The examples in this folder demonstrate how to run a migration test for a single model or for a number of models.

## Single model migration test
**migration_test_single_model.py** runs the migration test for a single model and produces a test report (BTC Project report, regression test template).

## Multi model migration suite
**migration_suite_multi_model.py** runs the migration test for a list of models and produces a BTC Summary report that links to each of the models' project report
