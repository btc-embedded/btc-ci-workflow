## Parallel Execution

This folder contains the file [parallel_execution.py](parallel_execution.py), an example, demonstrating how to run tests for multiple test projects (*.epp) in parallel using Python and BTC EmbeddedPlatform REST API with Docker.

On Windows, the same workflow can be run without docker as the BTC EmbeddedPlatform REST API wrapper can start the application directly.
