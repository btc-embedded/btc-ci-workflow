# Global config file for BTC EmbeddedPlatform CI workflow

#
# - if BTC_API_CONFIG_FILE is not set:
#   - a default config from the pip package btc_embedded is used

# Tolerances can be defined for RBT (requirements-based tests) and B2B (back-to-back & regression tests)
# and will automatically be applied (supported with EP 24.1 and beyond)
# For each scope, for each DISP/OUT the signal is checked:
# 1. Does the signal name match any of the "signal-name-based" tolerance definitions?
#   -> first matching tolerance definition is applied (based on regex <-> signal-name)
#   If no signal-name based tolerance was defined, default tolerances based no data type are considered:
# 2. Does the signal use a floating point data type? [ 'double', 'single', 'float', 'float32', 'float64', 'real' ]
#   -> apply default tolerances for floats (if defined)
# 3. Does the signal use a fixed-point data type? (integer with LSB < 1)
#   -> apply default tolerances for fixed-point (if defined)
#   -> tolerance can also be defined as a multiple of the LSB (e.g. 1*LSB)
#
# abs: absolute tolerance - a deviation <= abs will be accepted as PASSED
# rel: relative tolerance - accepted deviation <= (reference value * rel) will be accepted as PASSED
#      useful for floats to compensate for low precision on high float values
# tolerances:
#   B2B: 
#     # specific tolerances for matching signals
#     signal-name-based:
#       - regex: .*_write.*
#         rel: 2e-1
#       - regex: .*dsout_.*
#         abs: 4e-6
#         rel: 4e-4

#     # default tolerances for anything else
#     floating-point:
#       abs: 0.001
#       rel: 0.01
#     fixed-point:
#       abs: 1*LSB

# Additionally, you can specify arbitrary key-value pairs to use them in your scripts
# The goal is to separate any configuration from the code, so you can adapt your
# configuration without changing your code.
# 
# Example definition:
# myFavouriteReportName: awesome-test-report
# 
# Example usage:
# config = get_global_config()
# ...
# print("Creating report " + config['myFavouriteReportName']) 
# ep.post(f"reports/{report['uid']}", { 'exportPath': work_dir, 'newName': config['myFavouriteReportName'] })
